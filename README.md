# Berlin Gentrification Project

### _BA Thesis in Geography 2021_ 

For my BA Thesis Project, I analyze a range of demographic and real-estate data to generate a novel conceptually driven typology of gentrification to evaluate localized anti-displacement measures in Berlin. The full report will be published to this page by the end of May, but how I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed data for this project is described here. 

If you have any feedback or questions about this project, don't hesitate to email me at cschwab1@uchicago.edu.
