# Berlin Gentrification Project

### _BA Thesis in Geography 2021_ 

For my BA Thesis Project, I analyze a range of demographic and real-estate data to generate a novel conceptually driven typology of gentrification to evaluate localized anti-displacement measures in Berlin. The full report will be published to this page by the end of May, but how I gathered, cleaned, and analyzed data for this project is described here. 

The organization of this repository is a bit messy, but is essentially as follows: 

* __`rscripts/final`__ contains all the code for the project, roughly organized as individual tasks, with section 1 consisting of data cleaning, section 2 consisting of data processing/generation, section 3 consisting of analysis
* __`demographic`__ contains the MSS files, one part of the demographic data I used
* __`EinR`__ contains data from Berlin's resident register that I used
* __`Data_for_Analysis`__ is where I kept the results of each progressive script for easy loading. 

If you have any feedback or questions about this project, don't hesitate to email me at cschwab1@uchicago.edu.
